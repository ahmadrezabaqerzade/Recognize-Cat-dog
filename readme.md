Train cat&dog dataset with CNN-Models and Transformers

We purpose to show transformers power that can be usefully in sometimes that we want to train a datasets. At the first we train a dataset with CNN-Models because our dataset certain a cat and dog pictures. Then we use transformers. We need encoder part of transformers and we don't use decoder.

Our dataset include 2000 images for training part and 10 images for validation part.
We want to see by having a this dataset how much we reduce loss.
